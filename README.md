# Modern CPP

## C++ Build Step

- Preprocessing
  - statement begins with # are processed
  - include statement get replaced with file content
  - macros they are expanded
- Compilation
  - code is checked for correct syntax error
  - converted into object code
- Linking
  - The object code is linked with the standard libraries
- If there is no error then it generates an executable file

## Primitive types

- Arithmetic :
  - Arithmetic -> Integral & floating point
  - Integral type -> bool , char , wchar*t ,char16_t , char32* , short , int ,long
  - floating point -> float & double
- Void is a special type used with pointer & function

## Modifiers

- Some of these can be modified using modifires - signed , unsigned , short ,long
- All type can be qualified using qualifiers like const,static and volatile
- All type occupy memory and can hold a range of values
- Size of Data type
  - bool char 1byte
  - short wchar_t 2 byte
  - int long float 4 byte
  - long long, double, long double 8 byte
